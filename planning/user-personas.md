  frontend development, and is motivated to grow.

  extensive experience.

- Difficulty in finding candidates with a clear and well-organized portfolio.

- Lack of communication or follow-up from applicants during the hiring process.

  fixing UI bugs).
- They want someone who is willing to dedicate their time without expecting
  monetary compensation.

- Difficulty in finding tech-savvy volunteers who can deliver professional
  results while working part-time.

- Lack of clarity in portfolios, making it hard to judge if a volunteer has the

  developer has worked on similar projects or demonstrated experience with
  clean, user-friendly designs.

  examples.
