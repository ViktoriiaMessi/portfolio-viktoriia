A prioritized list of user stories to guide development. Adjust or expand as
needed.

## Must-Haves

- [ ] As a user, I want to see a convenient navigation bar so that I can quickly
      navigate to sections like "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and "Contact."

- [ ] As a user, I want to see a welcoming header that clearly states the
      developer's specialization, such as "Frontend Developer creating modern
      and user-friendly interfaces."

- [ ] As a user, I want to learn more about the developer, their professional
      background, motivation, and goals to better understand their approach to
      work.

- [ ] As a user, I want to see a list of technologies and tools the developer is
      proficient in (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) to assess their
      competencies.

- [ ] As a user, I want to view examples of the developer's completed projects
      with brief descriptions of the tasks, technologies used, and links to
      GitHub or live demos.

- [ ] As a user, I want to know if the developer offers services such as
      building websites or user interfaces to understand how I can collaborate
      with them. (If this is not applicable, this section can be replaced with
      "Contact the Developer.")

- [ ] As a user, I want to see logos or visual icons for technologies like HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript to quickly understand the developer's toolkit.

- [ ] As a user, I want access to the developer's contact information (email,
      LinkedIn, and GitHub links) to easily reach out if needed.

## Should-Haves

- [ ] As a user, I want to see modern animations or interactive elements to make
      the website look professional and demonstrate the developer's skills.

- [ ] As a user, I want the website to display correctly on any device (phones,
      tablets, desktops) so I can comfortably view the portfolio.

- [ ] As a user, I want to see descriptions of the problems solved in projects
      and the technologies used to evaluate the developer's approach to work.
